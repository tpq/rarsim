Description: Response-adaptive randomization (RAR) is a novel approach to experimental design
 that has the potential to reduce the cost of expensive clinical trials. However, it may be
 susceptible to inflated Type 1 or Type 2 errors. Simulations can help ensure that the
 trial design will not introduce spurious results. The rarsim package is designed
 to make it easier to run simulations for RAR experiments.
